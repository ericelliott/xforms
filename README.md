Experimental JavaScript transducers.

This collection is an experimental exploration of alternative transducer ergonomics in JavaScript.

## Status - EXPERIMENTAL

I recommend using [rxjs pipeable operators](https://v6.rxjs.dev/guide/v6/pipeable-operators) or transducers from [Ramda](https://ramdajs.com/) for production projects.
